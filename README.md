# diceRoller

This is a very beginner-friendly and simple project dice rolling android application that is built using Kotlin language. The user simply pushes a button "Let's Roll" and the dice gets rolled. The number on the dice is showed by vector illustrations of faces of a dice. I hope it gets you excited enough to try your luck with android development. Cheers!
