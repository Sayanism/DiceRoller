# diceRoller

This project is a very simple dice rolling android application that is built with Kotlin language. This is a very beginner friendly project. The user simply pushes a button "Let's Roll" and the dice gets rolled. The number on the dice is showed by vector illustrations of faces of a dice. I hope it gets you excitede enough to try your luck with android development. Cheers!
